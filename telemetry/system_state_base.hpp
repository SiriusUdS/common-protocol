/* The fields common to every board's periodic telemetry record. Both
 * FcuSystemState and EcuSystemState embed this as their leading `base` member, so
 * the shared prefix decodes identically on the ground regardless of source board.
 *
 * Board-specific peripherals (e.g. the FCU's Ethernet link) are added ALONGSIDE
 * `base` in the per-board record — that is where the two records diverge, and the
 * divergence is expected to grow. A field that stops being common (e.g. if one
 * board's valve count changes) moves out of here into the per-board records. */
